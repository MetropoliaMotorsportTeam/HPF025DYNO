Hi! i have some dyno data logs as csv. columns are as id + signal name. below each column they have value + time. examples. --> Columns= 1313:IVT_Result_I // then below value + time is = 2:2025-01-17 18:35:07. i understand grafana can be used to visualize this csv file with infinite plugin. however, how can i parse it so that it knows what to do with value+time because they have : between them, same as columns. The delimiter is ;
